# hoffman2-chem-notes

these are my notes for setting up and using hoffman2 using windows subsystem for linux (wsl). i have not included the steps for getting an account or getting access to gaussian.

## ssh customization 

Find where your .ssh folder is, for me it was

```
\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\USERNAME\.ssh
```
